VB Global is a ripple-protocol-based financial network to promote and develop the fastest and least expensive payment settlements systems on a global scale. It enables payments in all types of currency as easy as sending email.

As the core component of the VB Global network, the underlying VB Global is a series of servers that run peer to peer software. Anyone can freely set up a VB Globald server to being accepting or receiving payments. VB Global network introduces a second native currency 'HDU' which is designed to promote the spread and adoption of the VB Global network through a reward program. The reward program will be scheduled daily to distribute the pre-defined currency fairly to every eligible user. Using VB Globald is free and the VB Global network is owned by every participant.

This is the repository for VB Globallab's VB Global, reference P2P server.
